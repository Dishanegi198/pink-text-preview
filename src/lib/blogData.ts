      <h1>Barbie vs. Retro Fonts: Which One Fits Your Brand?</h1>
      
      <p>Fonts matter. A lot. They're not just letters. They tell people who you are before they read a single word. Are you bold? Playful? Serious? Chill? Fonts shout that out loud.</p>
      
      <p>Now, let's talk about two wild style worlds. <strong>Barbie fonts</strong> and <strong>Retro fonts</strong>. These two have major personalities. They're fun. They're stylish. They're totally different. So which one suits your brand? Let's break it down.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">What Are Barbie Fonts</h2>
      
      <p>Think pink. Think glitter. Think big hair and bubble gum. That's the Barbie vibe. These fonts come straight from the dream house. They're curvy, sweet, and super playful.</p>
      
      <p>Barbie fonts got famous from the classic doll logo. Back in 1959, the Barbie brand launched with a swirly handwritten logo. It's changed a bit but stayed girly and glam all the way.</p>
      
      <p>Barbie fonts usually:</p>
      
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 my-4">
        <li>Have fancy loops</li>
        <li>Look handwritten</li>
        <li>Feel soft and happy</li>
        <li>Work great for girly brands, makeup, toys, or fashion pages</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Examples? Try <strong>Dollie Script</strong> or <strong>Barbie Medium</strong>. They sparkle with personality.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">What Are Retro Fonts</h2>
      
      <p>Now flip the switch. Retro fonts toss you back into the funky disco days or 80s neon madness. These fonts are bold. Big. Wild. Retro fonts bring back good old-school vibes and pack a punch.</p>
      
      <p>They come from different time zones—like the 50s, 60s, 70s, or 80s. Each one has a different flavor. Some look groovy. Others are blocky or chunky. But all of them? Nostalgic.</p>
      
      <p>Retro fonts often:</p>
      
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 my-4">
        <li>Feel vintage or cool</li>
        <li>Pop in diner menus or old-school posters</li>
        <li>Fit with music brands, food trucks, or anything hipster</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Look up fonts like <strong>Pacifico</strong>, <strong>Lobster</strong>, or <strong>Bauhaus 93</strong> if you're curious.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Barbie vs. Retro — Font Showdown</h2>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Can You Mix Both</h2>
      
      <p>You bet. If your brand wants to feel fresh and fun with a dash of vintage charm, try mixing styles. Use Barbie fonts in the headline and retro fonts in the details.</p>
      
      <p>Just don't overdo it. Too many styles make your page look messy. Keep colors and sizes balanced. Always stay loyal to your main vibe.</p>
